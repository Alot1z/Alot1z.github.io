# üåü My GitHub Repository Wiki

**Live Demo:** Visit the interactive wiki at [https://Alot1z.github.io](https://Alot1z.github.io)

## ü§ñ About This Project

I created this repository wiki because I found myself drowning in hundreds of starred GitHub repositories. At 500+ repos, it became impossible to remember what tools I had saved, find specific projects, or even understand the breadth of my collection. I needed a way to organize, search, and actually make use of this curated knowledge.

This system transforms a chaotic collection of starred repos into a beautifully organized, searchable wiki that helps me:

- **Quickly find** the right tool for any project
- **Discover forgotten gems** in my collection
- **Understand patterns** in my technical interests
- **Share my curated knowledge** with others
- **Track updates** across my entire repository ecosystem
