# Research Plan: Local LLM Systems Analysis

## Objective
Research local LLM systems (Ollama, LM Studio, LocalAI, Open WebUI, etc.) with their API endpoints, model support, and configuration methods.

## Task Type
**Search-Focused Task**: Focus on information breadth and technical specification gathering.

## Systems to Research
- [x] 1. Ollama - Model management and API
- [x] 2. LM Studio - Local model hosting
- [x] 3. LocalAI - OpenAI-compatible API
- [x] 4. Open WebUI - Web-based interface
- [x] 5. Text Generation WebUI (oobabooga)
- [x] 6. vLLM - High-performance serving
- [x] 7. FasterTransformer - NVIDIA optimized
- [x] 8. llama.cpp - Lightweight inference

## Information to Gather for Each System
- [x] API endpoints and protocols
- [x] Supported model formats
- [x] Configuration methods
- [x] Hardware requirements
- [x] Installation procedures
- [x] Key features and capabilities
- [x] Integration examples

## Execution Plan
1. [x] Web search for each LLM system to find official documentation
2. [x] Extract detailed technical information from official sources
3. [x] Document API specifications and configuration details
4. [x] Organize data into structured JSON format
5. [x] Save final report to data/llm_providers/local_providers.json

## Output Format
JSON structure with system name, description, API details, model support, and configuration information.
