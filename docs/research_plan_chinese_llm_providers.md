# Chinese LLM Providers Research Plan

## Task Overview
Research Chinese LLM providers including their API endpoints, authentication methods, available models, and documentation, then compile into a structured JSON file at `data/llm_providers/chinese_providers.json`.

## Target Providers
- [ ] **Z.ai/GLM** - Research Zhipu AI's GLM models and API
- [ ] **Baidu (ERNIE)** - Research Baidu's ERNIE language models and API
- [ ] **Alibaba (Qwen)** - Research Alibaba's Qwen models and API
- [ ] **Tencent** - Research Tencent's LLM models and API
- [ ] **Minimax** - Research Minimax's models and API
- [ ] **Moonshot AI** - Research Moonshot's models and API
- [ ] **ByteDance (Doubao)** - Research ByteDance's Doubao models and API
- [ ] **SenseTime (InternLM)** - Research SenseTime's InternLM models and API
- [ ] **iFlytek (Spark)** - Research iFlytek's Spark models and API
- [ ] **Kuaishou (YI)** - Research Kuaishou's YI models and API

## Information to Collect for Each Provider
For each provider, gather:
- [ ] Company/Publisher name
- [ ] Model names and versions
- [ ] API base endpoints (Chat, Embeddings, etc.)
- [ ] Authentication methods (API Key, OAuth, etc.)
- [ ] Documentation URLs
- [ ] Pricing information
- [ ] Rate limits
- [ ] Key features and capabilities
- [ ] OpenAI-compatible status
- [ ] Regional availability
- [ ] Code examples if available

## Research Steps
1. [ ] **Initial Search** - Search for official documentation and API endpoints
2. [ ] **Provider Deep Dive** - Extract detailed information from each provider's website
3. [ ] **API Documentation Review** - Extract specific API information, authentication, models
4. [ ] **Verification** - Cross-reference information from multiple sources
5. [ ] **JSON Compilation** - Structure all information into the required JSON format
6. [ ] **Final Review** - Ensure completeness and accuracy

## Expected Deliverable
- Comprehensive JSON file at `data/llm_providers/chinese_providers.json`
- Structured data for all Chinese LLM providers
- Complete API information for integration purposes

## Status: In Progress
